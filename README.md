The code is for a two dimensional spring network under loading with possible fracture behaviors.

To more clearly find out the differences between linear model and nonlinear models, including the quadratic model, the exponential model, and the exponential model with history variable, please see ./spring models/Nonlinear-spring-models.ipynb

There also exists a test case to verify the correctness of the codes, please find ./test/2D-spring-network-a-test-case.ipynb

If the figures inserted in the Jupyter notebook are not shown, please refer to ./figures
